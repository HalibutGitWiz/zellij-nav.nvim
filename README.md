# zellij-nav.nvim

This is a Neovim plugin that integrates window navigation with
[zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij).

It creates four new commands that will move between windows inside Neovim (like
`^w h` et al.), but once it reaches the edge of your editor, it will attempt to
switch to the next zellij pane.

Commands:

- `ZellijNavigateLeft`
- `ZellijNavigateDown`
- `ZellijNavigateUp`
- `ZellijNavigateRight`
- `ZellijNavigateLeftTab`
- `ZellijNavigateDownTab`
- `ZellijNavigateUpTab`
- `ZellijNavigateRightTab`

It also exports the `lua` versions, which you can call like this:

- `require("zellij-nav").left()`
- `require("zellij-nav").down()`
- `require("zellij-nav").up()`
- `require("zellij-nav").right()`
- `require("zellij-nav").left_tab()`
- `require("zellij-nav").down_tab()`
- `require("zellij-nav").up_tab()`
- `require("zellij-nav").right_tab()`

This is written in the spirit of
[vim-tmux-navigator](https://github.com/alexghergh/nvim-tmux-navigation/), but
for zellij instead, while also aiming to be as simple and lightweight as
possible.

## Installing

### [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) (recommended)

```lua
{
  "https://git.sr.ht/~swaits/zellij-nav.nvim",
  lazy = true,
  event = "VeryLazy",
  keys = {
    { "<c-h>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateLeftTab<cr>",  { silent = true, desc = "navigate left or tab"  } },
    { "<c-j>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateDown<cr>",  { silent = true, desc = "navigate down"  } },
    { "<c-k>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateUp<cr>",    { silent = true, desc = "navigate up"    } },
    { "<c-l>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateRightTab<cr>", { silent = true, desc = "navigate right or tab" } },
  },
  opts = {},
}
```

### [pckr](https://github.com/lewis6991/pckr.nvim)

```lua
{
  "https://git.sr.ht/~swaits/zellij-nav.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("zellij-nav").setup()

    local map = vim.keymap.set
    map("n", "<c-h>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateLeftTab<cr>",  { desc = "navigate left or tab"  })
    map("n", "<c-j>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateDown<cr>",  { desc = "navigate down"  })
    map("n", "<c-k>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateUp<cr>",    { desc = "navigate up"    })
    map("n", "<c-l>", "<cmd>ZellijNavigateRightTab<cr>", { desc = "navigate right or tab" })

  end
}
```

### [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'https://git.sr.ht/~swaits/zellij-nav.nvim'
lua require("zellij-nav").setup()

nnoremap <c-h> <cmd>ZellijNavigateLeft<cr>
nnoremap <c-j> <cmd>ZellijNavigateDown<cr>
nnoremap <c-k> <cmd>ZellijNavigateUp<cr>
nnoremap <c-l> <cmd>ZellijNavigateRight<cr>
```

## Configuring Zellij

This plugin only covers the Neovim side of things. To achieve a fully seamless
workflow, we also need zellij to perform a few tasks.

In an ideal scenario, we would be able to map `C-hjkl` to function identically
in both zellij and Neovim, but unfortunately, that is not possible. Currently,
zellij has a few issues that prevent us from reaching that point.

Firstly, zellij does not allow us to bind `C-j` to any function. This is a
[known bug](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij/issues/2679).

Secondly, and more importantly, when any of the `C-hjkl` keystrokes are used in
zellij, we need to be able to:

1. Determine if the focused pane is running `nvim`.
2. If it is, forward the keystrokes to the application, for example, by using
   the zellij `Write` action.
3. If it is not, directly perform the keystroke action in zellij by using the
   `MoveFocus <direction>` action.

Currently, I have not found a way to accomplish this, even through the zellij
[plugin system](https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugins).

Therefore, my configuration uses `A-hjkl` in zellij. As a result, I use
`C-hjkl` to navigate within Neovim and to switch from Neovim to another zellij
pane. However, if I'm in a non-`nvim` pane, I use `A-hjkl` to change focus.
